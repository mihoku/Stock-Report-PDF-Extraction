# Stock-Report-PDF-Extraction
I got a freelance project to extract information from PDF Stock Transaction Report.

========CASE SPECIFICATION==========
##Python, extract text content from PDF file

I need a python script to extract text content from PDF files. After extracting the content apply regex/text manipulation to create a csv file.

Some knowledge of share market is required.

I can't provide you the original file as it contains confidential details,

I'll either provide you an edited file, if possible, which will have the text which requires extraction
or
I'll provide a jpg image in which case you need to write code and I'll execute.

This may require a lot of iteration and communication to explain what needs to be extracted.
